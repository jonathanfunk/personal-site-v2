This is a single page site for a marriage commissioner based in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. The objective of this project is to implement wedding booking functionality and content management system using WordPress.

This was a pretty straight forward project. Sections such as About, Services, FAQ and Testimonials are all customizable using Custom Field Suite and Custom Post Types. I used WP Booking Calendar to allow users to book their weddings and Contact Form 7 for sending messages. My biggest challenge for this project was styling the WP Booking Calendar to fit the theme of the site. I was able to work around it and the result was a happy client and busy wedding seasons.
