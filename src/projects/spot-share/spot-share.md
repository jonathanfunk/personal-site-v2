For this Parking Spot team project, I was tasked with implementing Google Maps React for mapping out available parking spots. I knew nothing about React 6 weeks ago but working with components, props, states, etc is starting to become second nature.

Google Maps React is a simple wrapper around the Google Maps Javascript API. There were obstacles learning about this library (I had to start again from scratch halfway through the project) but once I got it running I mapped out the parking spots using data from Meteor/MongoDB.

Once I got comfortable I got ambitious and implemented this library to the Share Spot page to give the users a visual when setting up their Share Spot. I also changed the marker icon using customized SVGs. My team and I were able to complete this application within a week.
