This is a single page website for The Wilderness of Manitoba, a folk band based in Toronto. The objective for this project is to build a site where the client can make changes ie photos, videos, discography.

This was one of the easiest sites Iâ€™ve built so far. For this project, I worked on planning ahead, sketching wireframes and writing down the dimensions before I code. I wrote the jQuery plugins for the hero image animation & expandable sections. I was able to finish this site quickly while maintaining quality.
