For our final project in the App Development Program at RED Academy, four other developers and I are tasked with building Potlucky, a potluck planning event mobile app. The host can start a potluck and fill out information such as where, when, how many dishes and who to invite. The guests will receive an email with all this information. The email will prompt them to download the app if they haven’t yet. Once the guests sign up, they will decide to accept/decline the invitation and let the host know what they will bring such as food, drinks, money or entertainment. This app was built with React Native and we used Firebase for storing data.

Prior to starting this project, my teammates and I were introduced to Agile Methodology Development which we used throughout the project. I’ve worked on different scenes and components throughout the app doing various tasks such as bug fixing and styling but I’ve worked extensively in the sign-in/sign-up and potluck event scenes. All of these use forms. I found great satisfaction in using the same form component for three different scenes. Because of my prior experience working with the Google Map libraries in past application projects, I was able to implement the Google Maps feature with relative ease.
